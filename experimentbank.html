<h1>Experiment Bank</h1>
	<p>I am working on building up a bank of experiments to allow staff and students to run experimental projects with more ease, and to help speed up the process of programming experiments.  Below is a list of tasks that have already been developed.  Some will run on Pavlovia 	(online experimental studies) and some will run in a face-to-face lab based environment.</p> 
	  <p>There are also a number of templates to help you to learn how to do common tasks, such as counterbalancing or allowing a participant to go back and forth through instructions to 	ensure they understand. </p>
<p>Experiments are hosted on GitLab and each experiment has a link to the specific GitLab Repository. In each of these you will find all of the resources that you will need to download to your own computer, modify and then upload to run on Pavlovia.</p>
<h3>Accessing the studies in GitLab</h3>
	<p>
	      <ul>
		      <li>You should <a href="https://gitlab.pavlovia.org/users/sign_in">create an account in Pavlovia</a> using your @hope credentials. This will also allow you automatic access to a GitLab repository. If you do not use your @hope email address to register, you will be unable to run your study online</li>
	      	<li>You can use the links below to download a template or project from Git
	     		 <img src="downloadfromgit.jpg"></li>
	      <li>Once downloaded you will be able to open the .psyexp file and edit to suit your experiment</li>
	      </ul>

<th>Cognitive Flexibility/Multitasking</th>
<td>In this multitasking experiment, we compare performance when just doing one task compared to when two tasks are mixed. In essence, this is simply a task switching paradigm. It is a cued task switching paradigm, although the cue (the location of the stimulus) and the imperative stimulus are presented at exactly the same time. In that sense, it is a bit mid-way between the alternative run and explicit cued-task paradigm<br>In this paradigm, we have two different types of comparisons:
Single tasking (doing a block of one task type) compared with multi-tasking (rapidly interleaving two tasks).
Within a multi-tasking block, task-repeat compared with task-switch trials (this is what task-switching paradigms typically study).</td>

<th>Delayed Matching to Sample Test</th>
<td>in The DMTS the participant is shown a sample stimulus and then, after a variable time, a pair of test stimuli and is asked to select the test stimulus that matches the earlier sample stimulus. Correct selection of the matching stimulus is reinforced. In zero-delay matching to sample, the test stimuli are presented as soon as the sample stimulus is removed. The task becomes more difficult as the time between the two presentations increases.

A centrally placed arrow is flanked by four more arrows, two at each side. The flanker arrows either face the same direction as the central arrow (congruent) or face the opposite direction to the central arrow (incongruent).

<th>Gender Neutrality Test</th>
<td>Participants were given sentences one clause at a time and asked to interpret the sentence. Sentences contained a definite ("teacher") or indefinite ("someone") antecedent and a pronoun, either definite ("he" or "she") or indefinite ("they"). The experimenters found that participants could read sentences with "they" as quickly as sentences with a pronoun that did match the stereotypical antecedent and faster than those where the pronoun did not match.<br> 
This finding implies that "they" can be used effectively as an indefinite pronoun where the gender of the person is unknown or unknowable. The problem with using "they" in English is that prescriptively, it is forbidden (as "they" is technically plural, and cannot be used with singular antecedents). This finding aims to point out that that does not mean people cannot understand the use of singular "they"

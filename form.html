        <h1>Obtaining Lab Access</h1>
	      <h4><a href="https://tinyurl.com/LHULabAccess">Lab Access Form</a></h4><p>You will need a password to access this form, you should check the Moodle for this password</p>
<p>In Psychology at Hope we actively encourage students at all levels of study to become involved in research. Research is such a big part of what we do as psychologists, and being involved in a culture of research will provide an excellent base for your future career in psychology</p>
	      <h3>Level C</h3><p>At Level C involvement in research is typically by virtue of being a participant in staff, postgraduate, and dissertation student research projects for course credits. This is a course requirement so please see <a href="sona.html">Participant Scheme (SONA)</a> for further information</a>
	      
	      <h3>Level I</h3><p>Occasionally Level I students will need to use the labs, and they should follow the process below</p> 
	      
	      
	      <h3>Level H and Level M</h3> <p>At Level H and M students using labs for dissertations will be guided by their supervisors to complete ethics forms and risk assessments for their projects. When both risk assessments and ethics have been approved Level H dissertation students will be able to apply for access to the Psychology labs.</p>
	      </p>
	      <ul><li>Once you have ethical approval and your risk assessment has been signed off by your dissertation supervisor you should go to <a href="https://tinyurl.com/LHULabAccess">the Lab Access Form</a> and complete all details</li>
		      <li>You will need a password to access this form, you should check the Moodle for this password</li>
		      <li>Assuming all details are correct, you will receive an email to state that you have been granted lab access. This email will also be sent to IT Heldesk who will thne update your swipe access to the labs</li><li> This may not be immediate, if you have waited for more than three days take your email to the IT Helpdesk in the Library where they will assist</li><li>If you do not have ethical aprroval or risk assessments then your request will be denied, and you will receive an email stating that you have one month to return to the form once you have approval etc.</li>
		      <li>After one month your data will be removed and you will have to apply again</li></ul>

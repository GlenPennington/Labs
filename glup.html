<li>No piece of equipment / protocol shall be used until the student is proficient and ‘signed off’ their supervisor (as appropriate)</li>
<li>Undergraduate and postgraduate students must consult with their supervisors about their practical work in order that the potential hazards associated with their research be assessed and practicable precautions / procedures be put into place </li>
</ol>
